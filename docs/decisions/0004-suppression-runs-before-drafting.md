# 0004 — Suppression runs before drafting, not after

Status: accepted; the complementary-scope refinement ("grouped by crosstab",
`_group_key`) is superseded by 0005, which found that the per-group scope
severed real accounting identities and widened the disclosure scope to the
whole report.

## Context

Code review of the v0.2 small-cell suppression work (`9deb8cf`) found that the
implementation faithfully followed the order recorded in `CLAUDE.md` and
`docs/ROADMAP.md` — `compute → draft → ground → suppress → approve → export` —
and that this order is itself the bug. `_cmd_run` drafted the narrative and
rendered the charts from the figures the metric engine computed, ran the
grounding gate against that same pre-suppression set, and only called
`suppress_figures` afterward, on the figures written to the receipts section.
The documented rationale was that suppression should be "the last transform
before a human sees the report, so what they approve is what ships" — but no
human-approval step exists in the code; `approve` in the diagram names a step
that was never built. With nothing between grounding and export, a report
shipped with the drafted narrative's plain English stating a below-threshold
count in full ("Of the 10 who exited the program, 6 moved into permanent
housing"), directly above a receipts section marking those same metrics
`[SUPPRESSED]`. The same gap let a comparison table read its period and delta
figures from `ComparisonResult`, a structure independent of whatever
suppression later did to the flat figure list, so a quarter's small count
could leak through the comparison table even when the identical metric_id was
correctly redacted everywhere else.

Separately, `suppress_figures` itself only redacted a figure's own `value` and
`display`; the `Receipt` attached to a "suppressed" figure was the original,
unredacted one, unchanged. `report.py`, `receipts_manifest`, and `trace.py` all
read `receipt.row_count` and `receipt.value` directly, not `Figure.value`, so
every rendered artifact showed the raw row count and value next to the
"[SUPPRESSED]" label regardless of drafting order. Both defects had to be
fixed together: reordering alone does not help if the receipt a correctly-timed
caller reads is still unredacted, and redacting the receipt alone does not help
if the narrative was already drafted from the raw value before suppression ran.

## Decisions

### Suppression is the first transform after compute, not the last before export

New order: `compute → receipt → suppress → draft → ground → human-approve →
export`. `_cmd_run` calls `suppress_figures` immediately after computing the
figure set (including any comparison figures), before `draft` or
`render_charts` run. The grounding gate then runs against the *suppressed*
figures, so a `[SUPPRESSED]` placeholder — not the number it replaced — is what
the gate is checking narrative and chart numbers against. This removes the
dependency on a human-approval step that does not exist: there is no window in
which a raw sub-threshold value is ever handed to the drafter or the chart
renderer.

### A suppressed figure's receipt is redacted, not reused

`suppress_figures` now constructs a new `Receipt` for every redacted figure,
zeroing `value` and `row_count` and replacing `slice_hash` with the canonical
empty-slice hash (`EMPTY_SLICE_HASH`), rather than attaching the original
receipt "for audit trail." A hash of the exact suppressed rows is itself a
verification oracle against a guessed row set; it is redacted along with the
count. `value_sql`, `unit`, `computed_at`, and `definition` are kept, since
they describe the query rather than the data.

### `ComparisonResult` is rebuilt from the suppressed figure set

`redact_comparison` takes an already-suppressed flat figure list and rebuilds
`ComparisonResult.rows` and `.figures` by metric_id lookup, so
`render_comparison_table` renders the same redaction the report, manifest, and
trace view do. `_cmd_run` calls it once, immediately after `suppress_figures`,
before the comparison is used anywhere else.

### Complementary suppression is a real arithmetic check, grouped by crosstab

The complementary pass no longer matches metric_id substrings ("total", "all",
"sum", "aggregate"). It checks, for every suppressed figure, whether its exact
value is reconstructable by adding or subtracting other still-visible figures
in the same group, and suppresses the smallest-valued figure in a disclosing
combination (the standard next-smallest-cell rule), repeating to a fixed point.
Two refinements were necessary to keep this from over- or under-suppressing:

- The check is scoped to a group (`_group_key`): a comparison metric's period
  and delta figures (`exits__q1`, `exits__q2`, `exits__delta`) group by their
  base metric_id, and every other figure — the report's own headline metrics —
  shares one group. Checking arbitrary figures against each other, across
  unrelated metric families, produced coincidental numeric collisions with no
  real relationship behind them (verified against `examples/grant-report/`: an
  unrelated headline count and a different quarter's exit count happened to
  subtract to the same integer as a suppressed cell).
- A delta figure (`_DELTA_SUFFIX`) is never scanned as a target. A delta is
  *defined* as current minus prior, so it is tautologically "recoverable" from
  its own two period figures; treating that as a discovered disclosure
  cascaded into suppressing an already-safe period figure for no privacy
  benefit, since the reader could already compute the delta from the two
  period values regardless of what the delta figure itself displays. A delta
  can still act as a candidate for reconstructing one of its own periods if it
  is left visible while that period is suppressed — that risk is real, not
  definitional.

### `SuppressionResult.ok` checks the invariant it claims to check

`ok` now verifies that no metric_id in `unsuppressed` has an original value
below threshold, using a `values` field carried on the result for exactly this
purpose, replacing a count comparison (`len(unsuppressed) < len(suppressed)`)
that could not detect a single leaked cell with nothing to compare it against.

## Consequences

- The privacy invariant — a sub-threshold count never appears in an exported
  artifact — no longer depends on an unbuilt human-approval step. It is
  enforced by construction: the drafter, the chart renderer, the comparison
  table, and the grounding gate only ever see the suppressed figure set.
- `tests/test_suppression.py` gained an end-to-end integration test that runs
  `receipts run` on `examples/housing-demo` and string-searches the actual
  rendered `report.md`, `receipts.json`, and `trace.html` for the raw
  suppressed values, rather than only asserting on the in-memory `Figure`.
- A few existing tests asserted the old, name-heuristic complementary-
  suppression behavior (suppressing whatever was named "total" regardless of
  whether it actually discloses anything, or leaving an accidentally-named
  figure alone regardless of a real relationship). Those assertions changed to
  match verified-correct behavior; see `tests/test_suppression.py` and
  `tests/test_grounded_sections.py`.
- `CLAUDE.md` and `docs/ROADMAP.md`'s architecture order are updated to match;
  neither described the fix, only the order that produced the bug.
